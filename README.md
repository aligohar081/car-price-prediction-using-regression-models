Building a Machine Learning Model to Predict the Price of the Car By Comparing Performance of Different Regression Techniques (Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression)
<br>
<i>Comparing these three models, we conclude that the <b>Multiple Linear Regression</b> model is the best model to be able to predict price from our dataset.</i> This result makes sense, since we have 27 variables in total, and we know that more than one of those variables are potential predictors of the final car price.
